The project was created to experiment with Python and PySimpleGUI to create a basic language practice tool.

The program creates random translation questions pulled from a DB of key-value language translations for a user to practice with.
This is done using a GUI similar to flashcards.

Polish_flag.ico used to create a shortcut, launching the program with main.py
Console window can be removed by changing main.py to main.pyw
Required fonts are provided within the resource folder.
